# Mayabonustools-2020
## Overview:

Github mirror for MayaBonusTools for Maya 2020 (May work on later versions). Nothing has been updated, it's just extracted for you here so you can install it easily.


## Installation
1. Download the repo as a zip
2. Unzip the contents to your MyDocuments\Maya\2020\Scripts folder
3. Optionally: If you already have a userSetup.mel file, don't overwrite it and instead add the following line to it: "bonusToolsMenu;"
